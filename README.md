# karma-farm

Requirements:
- Selenium - installed with pip
- Chrome web driver - https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

## usage
- put your info into the 4 lines
- be sure to use only your username without tagging with "@" in the spam sequence. this allows it to run much faster
- a separate instance of chrome will open and run the script as you can see it
- wait times work for me but might need to be adjusted.  time.sleep() is the method used.

### Enjoy!
