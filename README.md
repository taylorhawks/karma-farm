# karma-farm

Requirements:
- Selenium - installed with pip
- Chrome web driver - https://sites.google.com/a/chromium.org/chromedriver/home

Chrome web driver should be in the same directory as the script itself.

## Usage
- Put your info into the first 4 lines
- Be sure to use only your username without tagging with "@" in the spam sequence. This allows it to run much faster.
- A separate instance of chrome will open and run the script in a window you can see.
- Wait times work for me but might need to be adjusted.  time.sleep() is the method used.

### Enjoy!
